# Linear Model
1. Feed in training examples
2. Find the parameters that makes the linear model fit best to the data (`training the data`)

How do we know which values will make the model perform best? To answer this question, we need to specify a performance measure, by either defne a `utility/fitness function` to measure how **good** the model is , or define a `cost function` that measures how **bad** it is.

For Linear Regression problems, people typically use a `cost function` that measures the distance between the linear model's predictions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.
