# Linear Model
1. Feed in training examples
2. Find the parameters that makes the linear model fit best to the data (`training the data`)

How do we know which values will make the model perform best? To answer this question, we need to specify a performance measure, by either defne a `utility/fitness function` to measure how **good** the model is , or define a `cost function` that measures how **bad** it is.

For Linear Regression problems, people typically use a `cost function` that measures the distance between the linear model's predictions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.

## What is linear regression

## Parameters and hyperparameters
* Models have **parameters** that are fitted to data
* **Hyperparameters** are not changed during fitting
    * Manually set before fitting
    * It is up to us to set an approprite value
    * For example the value of k in k-nearest neighbour
    * Or degree of polynomial

* How to determine appropriate values
    * If small number of options, try them all (grid search)
    * Larger number of options: randomly sample from options and keep the best
    * 'Best" is usually measured by validation error
